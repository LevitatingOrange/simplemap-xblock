A XBlock (for the openedx eLearning platform) to show a map with configurable markers.

## TODO
- [ ] min browser version, pass to esbuild
- [ ] include source map for easier debugging
- [ ] Poetry seems buggy and does not want to include package_data that is also in gitignore even though it should when specified via include. This means build output gets commited to git...
